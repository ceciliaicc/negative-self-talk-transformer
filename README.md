# 🌟 Negative Self-Talk Transformer 🌈  
Transform your inner critic into your biggest cheerleader!  
A fine-tuned NLP model to turn negative self-talk into compassionate affirmations.  

---

## 🚀 About the Project  
Have you ever caught yourself thinking, *"I'm not good enough"* or *"I can't do this"*? You're not alone! The **Negative Self-Talk Transformer** is here to help reframe those thoughts into empowering, self-compassionate statements.  

### ✨ What This Model Does  
Using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, the model:  
- 🧠 Understands your input with context and nuance.  
- 💌 Responds with affirmations full of kindness and empathy.  
- 🌱 Encourages self-growth and positivity!

## 💡 How It Works  

**Before fine-tuning**: The model gave responses that were unhelpful or missed the mark.  
**After fine-tuning**: It provides supportive, thoughtful responses tailored to your input! 🎉  

For example:  
| Input: "I can’t even take care of myself. I will never be a good dog mom."  
| **Before**: "I'm sorry, I'm not a good dog mom."  
| **After**: "It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, but you are capable of taking care of yourself and your dog. Try saying, 'I am capable of learning and growing as a dog mom, and that’s okay.'" 🐾
